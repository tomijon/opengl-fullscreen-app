# OpenGL Fullscreen Application Template for C++
Use this template to get a basic window opened with an OpenGL context attached.

Built for Windows.
Should hopefully support MAC and LINUX although this is untested. 

## Setup
This project requires `CMake (minimum 3.31)` to set up. (It might work with lower versions but is untested).
In the root directory:
```
cmake -B build
```

To change the name of the project, change the argument of the project function found at the top of the root CMakeLists.txt.
